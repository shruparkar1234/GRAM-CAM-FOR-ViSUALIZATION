## GRAM-CAM-FOR-VISUALIZAZTION
This repository explores how Grad-CAM helps to visualize which parts of an input image is being focused upon by our trained model. It is a very handy technique for debugging introduced by Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju et al. in their paper “Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.” (arXiv (2017), https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391.)
